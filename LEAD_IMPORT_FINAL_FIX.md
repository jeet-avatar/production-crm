# Lead Import - Final Fix Deployed ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 14, 2025, 06:52 UTC
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED AND READY TO TEST**

---

## Critical Issue Resolved

### The Problem
**ALL lead imports were failing** with this error:
```
Failed to import lead
Unique constraint failed on the fields: (email)
```

**Root Cause**: Empty email strings from API were causing unique constraint violations

---

## The Bug

The Lead Discovery API returns leads **without emails** (empty string `""`):

```json
{
  "LeadName": "Danielle Tarp",
  "company": "NetSuite",
  "LinkedinLink": "https://linkedin.com/in/danielle-tarp",
  "email": ""  // ‚ùå Empty string
}
```

### Previous Code (Broken)
```typescript
const email = leadData.email && leadData.email.trim()
  ? leadData.email.trim()
  : null;
```

**Why it failed**:
- Empty string `""` is **truthy** in JavaScript
- `"".trim()` returns `""` (still a string)
- Multiple contacts with `""` email violate unique constraint
- PostgreSQL treats empty string as a value, not null

### New Code (Fixed)
```typescript
const email = leadData.email?.trim() || null;
```

**Why it works**:
- Empty string is **falsy** in `||` operator
- `"".trim() || null` evaluates to `null`
- Multiple `null` values are allowed in unique columns
- No constraint violation!

---

## What Was Fixed

### Line 267 in leads.routes.ts

**Before**:
```typescript
const email = leadData.email && leadData.email.trim()
  ? leadData.email.trim()
  : null;
```

**After**:
```typescript
const email = leadData.email?.trim() || null;
```
