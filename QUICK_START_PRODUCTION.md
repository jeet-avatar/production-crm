## ðŸš¨ COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: "502 Bad Gateway"
**Cause:** Backend not running or security group blocking
**Fix:**
```bash
pm2 status  # Check if running
pm2 logs    # Check for errors
# Verify security group allows ALB â†’ EC2 on port 3000
```

### Issue: "Database connection failed"
**Cause:** Wrong credentials or security group
**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Test connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"

# Check security group allows EC2 â†’ RDS on port 5432
```

### Issue: "CORS errors"
**Cause:** FRONTEND_URL mismatch
**Fix:**
```bash
# In backend .env, ensure:
FRONTEND_URL=https://brandmonkz.com

# Restart PM2
pm2 restart brandmonkz-crm
```

### Issue: "SSL certificate not trusted"
**Cause:** Certificate not fully propagated
**Fix:**
- Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation
- Verify ACM certificate status is "Issued"
- Check CloudFront uses correct certificate ARN
