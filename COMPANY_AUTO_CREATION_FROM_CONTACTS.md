# Company Auto-Creation from Contacts ✅

**Date**: October 14, 2025, 08:45 UTC
**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**

---

## Feature Overview

When adding a contact manually, you can now type a company name and the system will **automatically create the company** if it doesn't exist. The company will be properly tagged with its data source and have all features available (AI Enrich, SocialFlow, etc.).

---

## What's New

### 1. **Type Company Name to Create** ✨

When adding a contact:
- **Option 1**: Select existing company from dropdown
- **Option 2**: Type new company name in text field
- Company is automatically created
- Contact is linked to that company
- Company appears in Companies list

### 2. **New Data Sources** 🏷️

Added two new company data sources:

**`manual_contact`** - 👤 Added via Contact
- Companies created when manually adding a contact
- Marked with indigo badge
- Shows "Added via Contact" in company details

**`socialflow`** - 🌊 SocialFlow
- Companies enriched with SocialFlow integration
- Marked with cyan badge
- Shows "SocialFlow Enrichment" in details

### 3. **Consistent Data Source Labels** 📊

All company sources now display with icons:
- 📝 Manual Entry (gray)
- ⚡ Apollo.io (purple)
- 📄 Manual Research / CSV Import (blue)
- ✨ AI Enrichment (default)
- 🎯 Lead Discovery (green)
- 👤 Added via Contact (indigo) **NEW**

## How It Works

### User Flow

#### Before This Update ❌
```
1. User wants to add contact "John Doe" from "Getaround"
2. Goes to Contacts → Add Contact
3. Types name, email, etc.
4. Company field: dropdown shows existing companies only
5. If "Getaround" doesn't exist:
   - Can't select it
   - Must first go to Companies page
   - Manually create "Getaround" company
   - Go back to Contacts
   - Add contact and select "Getaround"
6. Frustrating! 😞
```

#### After This Update ✅
```
1. User wants to add contact "John Doe" from "Getaround"
2. Goes to Contacts → Add Contact
3. Types name: John Doe
4. Company field:
   - Dropdown: Select existing (if exists)
   - OR
   - Text input: Type "Getaround"
5. See message: "✨ A new company 'Getaround' will be created"
6. Click Save
7. System:
   - Creates contact "John Doe" ✅
   - Creates company "Getaround" ✅
   - Links contact to company ✅
   - Marks company as "manual_contact" source ✅
8. Done! Easy! 😊
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### POST /api/contacts Enhanced

**New Parameters**:
```typescript
{
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
  role?: string;
  companyId?: string;        // Existing company ID
  companyName?: string;      // NEW: Company name to create
  status: string;
  tagIds?: string[];
}
```

**Logic**:
```typescript
if (!companyId && companyName && companyName.trim()) {
  // Check if company exists
  const existing = await prisma.company.findFirst({
    where: {
      userId: userId,
      name: companyName.trim()
    }
  });

  if (existing) {
    // Use existing company
    finalCompanyId = existing.id;
  } else {
    // Create new company
    const newCompany = await prisma.company.create({
      data: {
        name: companyName.trim(),
        dataSource: 'manual_contact', // Mark source
        userId: userId
      }
    });
    finalCompanyId = newCompany.id;
  }
}

// Create contact with companyId
await prisma.contact.create({
  data: {
    ...contactData,
    companyId: finalCompanyId
  }
});
```
