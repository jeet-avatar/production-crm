# Project State

Last activity: 2026-03-19 - Completed Phase 02 Plan 03: QuoteBuilder modal + ContractEditor modal + DocumentsTab fully wired (human-verify checkpoint approved)

## Current Phase
Phase 02: Quote and Contract Lifecycle

## Current Position
- Phase: 02-quote-contract-lifecycle — COMPLETE (all 3 plans done)
- Plan: 03 (complete) — QuoteBuilder modal, ContractEditor modal, DocumentsTab fully wired, human-verify approved
- Next: Phase 03 — CRM Migration Wizard (03-01-PLAN.md: backend POST /api/deals/bulk-import)

## Decisions Made
- Prisma migration applied via `db push` (non-interactive) instead of `migrate dev` (requires TTY); manual migration SQL file created for audit trail
- Decimal fields serialized with `Number()` helper in quotes route to prevent Prisma Decimal serialization issues
- Hard delete (not soft delete) used for quotes and contracts per plan spec
- Deal ownership validated before creating quote/contract
- New Quote button gated to CLOSED_WON stage in DocumentsTab shell; Wave 3 will wire the actual handlers
- ArrowTopRightOnSquareIcon used for view-detail button on DealBoard cards (confirmed in heroicons package)
- dealsApi.getById was already present in api.ts — no addition needed
- Plan 03: Modal state (showQuoteBuilder/showContractEditor) owned inside DocumentsTab, not passed as callbacks from DealDetail — reduces coupling
- Plan 03: resolveVariables stores resolved content at submit time; raw template (with placeholders) is not persisted separately
- Plan 03: window.prompt used for SIGNED contract signer name — keeps UI simple for an edge-case interaction
- Plan 03: Subtotal/total computed inline during render (not useState + useEffect) to avoid stale state

## Blockers/Concerns
None
