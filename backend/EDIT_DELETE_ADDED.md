const [deleting, setDeleting] = useState(false);
```

const handleDelete = async () => {
  if (!company) return;
  setDeleting(true);
  try {
    await companiesApi.delete(company.id);
    navigate('/companies');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error deleting company:', err);
    setError('Failed to delete company');
    setDeleting(false);

## API Endpoints Used

### Edit Company
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/companies/:id`
- **Method**: Already implemented in backend
- **Service**: `companiesApi.update(id, data)`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working

### Delete Company
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/companies/:id`
- **Method**: Already implemented in backend

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### For Contacts Page
You may also want to add Edit/Delete buttons to the contacts page following the same pattern:

1. Add Edit and Delete buttons to contact details page
2. Use existing ContactForm component for editing
3. Add delete confirmation modal
4. Use `contactsApi.update()` and `contactsApi.delete()`

The backend endpoints are already available:
- `PUT /api/contacts/:id` - Edit contact
- `DELETE /api/contacts/:id` - Delete contact

### Bulk Operations
- Add checkboxes to company list for bulk selection
- Add "Delete Selected" button
- Implement bulk delete with confirmation

### Undo/Restore
- Add "Recently Deleted" view
- Allow restoring soft-deleted companies
- Add permanent delete option for admins

---

## Troubleshooting

### Edit button doesn't appear
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Verify you're viewing the company details page (not list)
- Check browser console for errors

### Edit modal doesn't open
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify CompanyForm component is properly imported
- Try hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)

### Delete doesn't work
- Verify you have ownership of the company
- Check network tab for API errors
- Verify backend server is running

### Changes don't save
- Check network tab for API response
- Verify authentication token is valid
- Check server logs: `ssh ec2-user@18.212.225.252 && pm2 logs`

---

## Support

### Check Logs
```bash
# Frontend (Nginx)
ssh ec2-user@18.212.225.252
