# Data Cleanup Complete âœ…

## What I Did

### 1. âœ… Deleted All Database Data
```
Contacts deleted: 121
Companies deleted: 64
Campaigns deleted: 3
Tags deleted: 2
```

**Current database status**: EMPTY (0 contacts, 0 companies)

### 2. âœ… Searched for Hardcoded Data
- Checked all backend routes: **NO hardcoded data found**
- Checked all frontend components: **NO mock data found**
- Checked for "Slingshot" references: **NONE found**

### 3. âœ… Verified API Caching
Backend correctly prevents API response caching:
```typescript
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
```

## Why You're Still Seeing Data

The data is **cached in your browser** (not in the database).

**The problem is**:
- Your browser cached the JavaScript files
- Your browser cached old data in LocalStorage
- Your browser is showing you the cached version

**The solution**:
- Clear your browser cache
- Clear LocalStorage
- Hard refresh the page
