# ✅ All Fixes Complete - Ready to Import

## What Was Fixed

### 1. CSV Import Bug (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: All contacts were being assigned to one company (Slingshot Sports)
**Solution**: Changed company matching to use ONLY exact company name, filtered out generic domains like linkedin.com

### 2. Company Import UI (Fixed ✅)
**Problem**: No "Next" button - forced into AI enrichment
**Solution**: Added "Skip AI & Import Now" button alongside "Enhance with AI"

### 3. Database Cleaned (Done ✅)
**Status**: All old incorrect data deleted (319 contacts, 4 companies)

## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Clear Your Browser Cache
The frontend has been updated, but you need to reload it:

**On Mac**:
- Chrome/Edge: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Safari: Press `Cmd + Option + R`

**On Windows**:
- Chrome/Edge: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Firefox: Press `Ctrl + F5`

### Step 2: Re-Import Your CSV Files
Now that the bug is fixed:
1. Go to sandbox.brandmonkz.com
2. Import your contact CSV files
3. Each contact will be correctly assigned to its own company

---

## What Will Work Now

✅ **Each contact shows its own company name** (not all showing the same company)
✅ **Each contact shows its own role/position**
✅ **Contacts are grouped by their actual companies**
✅ **Company import has "Skip AI" option** (no forced AI enrichment)

## How the Fix Works

### Backend Logic
- Matches companies by **exact company name only** (not by domain)
- Filters out generic domains like linkedin.com, facebook.com, twitter.com
- Creates separate companies for each unique company name in your CSV

### Frontend Display
- Shows each contact with their own company data
- Groups contacts by their actual company names
- Displays role/position for each contact
