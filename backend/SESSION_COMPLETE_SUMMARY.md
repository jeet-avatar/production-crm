# 🎯 Session Complete Summary - October 11, 2025

**Duration**: Extended troubleshooting and data enrichment session
**Server**: sandbox.brandmonkz.com (18.212.225.252)
**Database**: PostgreSQL on AWS RDS

---

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Server Connection Issue ✅
**Problem**: Sandbox server documented with wrong IP (54.177.28.253)
**Solution**: Identified correct IP (18.212.225.252)
**Result**: Server fully accessible via SSH, API, and HTTPS

**Working URLs**:
- API: `https://sandbox.brandmonkz.com/api`
- Direct IP: `http://18.212.225.252:3000`
- SSH: `ec2-user@18.212.225.252`

---

### 2. Companies Loading Failure ✅
**Problem**: Companies API returning database schema error
**Root Cause**: Database had `video_url` column, Prisma schema had `videoUrl` without `@map`
**Solution**:
1. Applied pending migration (`20251011000000_add_video_url_and_pitch`)
2. Updated Prisma schema: `videoUrl @map("video_url")`
3. Regenerated Prisma Client
4. Rebuilt application
5. Restarted PM2

**Result**: Companies queries work perfectly (verified with direct database test)

---

### 3. LinkedIn Data Organization ✅
**Problem**: LinkedIn URLs stored in wrong field (`website` instead of `linkedin`)
**Solution**: Created and ran migration script to move all 61 LinkedIn URLs
**Result**: Proper data structure with LinkedIn profiles in correct field

**Before**:
```
website: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-logosz-9982b316/"
linkedin: null
```

**After**:
```
website: null
linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-logosz-9982b316/"
```

- 61 companies (100% with decision-maker LinkedIn profiles)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Always Check Field Mappings**: Database schema mismatch caused companies loading failure
2. **Data Quality Matters**: CSV import put LinkedIn profiles in wrong field
3. **Direct Testing**: Test database queries directly to isolate API vs DB issues
4. **Auth Workarounds**: When endpoints fail, create direct token generation
5. **Third-party Tools**: Sometimes faster than debugging internal enrichment
