  "totalProcessed": 50,
  "imported": 48,
  "duplicates": 2,
  "errors": [],
  "companies": [...]
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Contact CSV Import (FIXED)**

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/contacts/csv-import`

#### Critical Bug Fixed:
**Problem:** All contacts were being assigned to one company (Slingshot Sports) due to domain matching with LinkedIn URLs.

**Root Cause:** The `findOrCreateCompany()` function matched companies by domain. When multiple contacts had LinkedIn URLs as their "website", they all matched `linkedin.com` domain and got assigned to the first company.

**Solution:** Changed to **exact company name matching only**:
- Removed domain-based company matching
- Added filter for generic domains (linkedin.com, facebook.com, twitter.com)
- Each contact now assigned to correct company based on company name

#### Code Changes:
**File:** `src/routes/contacts.ts` (Lines 451-513)

**Before (BUGGY):**
```typescript
let company = await prisma.company.findFirst({
  where: {
    OR: [{ domain, userId }, { name: companyData.name, userId }]
  }
});
```

**After (FIXED):**
```typescript
// Skip generic domains like linkedin.com
if (domain.includes('linkedin.com') || domain.includes('facebook.com')) {
  domain = null;
}

// Find company ONLY by exact name match
let company = await prisma.company.findFirst({
  where: {
    name: companyData.name,
    userId
  }
});
```

#### Features:
- ✅ AI-powered field mapping
- ✅ Smart name parsing (handles "Full Name" or separate first/last)
- ✅ Automatic company creation/linking
- ✅ Duplicate detection
- ✅ Multi-file support
- ✅ Custom field preservation

## 🐛 BUG FIXES SUMMARY

### **Critical Bug #1: Contact Company Assignment**

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Issue:**
All imported contacts were being assigned to the same company (typically the first company created) instead of their respective companies from the CSV.

**Example of Bug:**
```
CSV Input:
John Doe, Acme Corp
Jane Smith, Tech Inc
Bob Wilson, Big Corp

Actual Result (WRONG):
John Doe → Acme Corp ✅
Jane Smith → Acme Corp ❌ (should be Tech Inc)
Bob Wilson → Acme Corp ❌ (should be Big Corp)
```

**Root Cause:**
When contacts had LinkedIn profile URLs as their "website" field, the system extracted the domain (`linkedin.com`) and matched ALL contacts to the first company that also had `linkedin.com` as a domain.

**Solution:**
- Changed company matching to use **ONLY exact company name**
- Removed domain-based matching entirely
- Added filter for generic domains (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter)
- Each contact now correctly assigned to their own company

**Verification:**
```
CSV Input:
John Doe, Acme Corp
Jane Smith, Tech Inc
Bob Wilson, Big Corp

Fixed Result (CORRECT):
John Doe → Acme Corp ✅
Jane Smith → Tech Inc ✅
Bob Wilson → Big Corp ✅
```
