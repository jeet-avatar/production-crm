## Frontend Implementation

### Step 1: Copy Components

All React components are provided in `EDIT_DELETE_GUIDE.md`:

1. **CompanyEditForm.tsx** - Form for editing company details
2. **ContactEditForm.tsx** - Form for editing contact details
3. **DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx** - Confirmation dialog for deletions
4. **ActionButtons.tsx** - Edit and delete buttons

### Step 2: Add to Your Pages

**Company List/Details Page**:
```tsx
import { CompanyEditForm } from './CompanyEditForm';
import { DeleteConfirmationModal } from './DeleteConfirmationModal';
import { ActionButtons } from './ActionButtons';

// In your component:
<ActionButtons
  type="company"
  item={company}
  authToken={authToken}
  onEditClick={() => setShowEditForm(true)}
  onDeleteSuccess={() => refreshCompanies()}
/>

{showEditForm && (
  <CompanyEditForm
    company={company}
    authToken={authToken}
    onSuccess={(updated) => {
      setCompany(updated);
      setShowEditForm(false);
    }}
    onCancel={() => setShowEditForm(false)}
  />
)}
```

**Contact List/Details Page**:
```tsx
import { ContactEditForm } from './ContactEditForm';
import { DeleteConfirmationModal } from './DeleteConfirmationModal';
import { ActionButtons } from './ActionButtons';

// In your component:
<ActionButtons
  type="contact"
  item={contact}
  authToken={authToken}
  onEditClick={() => setShowEditForm(true)}
  onDeleteSuccess={() => refreshContacts()}
/>

{showEditForm && (
  <ContactEditForm
    contact={contact}
    authToken={authToken}
    onSuccess={(updated) => {
      setContact(updated);
      setShowEditForm(false);
    }}
    onCancel={() => setShowEditForm(false)}
  />
)}
```

### Step 3: Style

Copy the CSS from `EDIT_DELETE_GUIDE.md` or customize to match your design system.

## Key Features

- **User Isolation**: Users can only edit/delete their own data
- **Ownership Verification**: All requests verify ownership before operation
- **JWT Authentication**: Required for all endpoints
- **404 Protection**: Returns 404 for non-existent or non-owned resources

### Data Safety ✅
- **Soft Deletes**: Data marked as inactive, not permanently removed
- **Update Tracking**: `updatedAt` timestamp automatically maintained
- **Validation**: Required fields enforced
- **Conflict Detection**: Email uniqueness validated for contacts

### User Experience ✅
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Delete operations require confirmation
- **Loading States**: Buttons disabled during operations
- **Error Messages**: Clear error feedback to users
- **Success Feedback**: Success messages after operations

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I permanently delete data?**
A: Currently, the API uses soft deletes (marks as inactive). To permanently delete, you would need to modify the backend code to use `prisma.*.delete()` instead of update.

**Q: What happens to contacts when I delete a company?**
A: Contacts remain in the database but their `companyId` reference will point to an inactive company. They won't show the company in lists.

**Q: Can I restore deleted items?**
A: Yes, since it's a soft delete. You can set `isActive: true` in the database, or create a "restore" endpoint.

**Q: What fields can I edit for companies?**
A: name, domain, industry, size, description, website, location

**Q: What fields can I edit for contacts?**
A: firstName, lastName, email, phone, status, companyId, tagIds

**Q: How do I know if an edit/delete succeeded?**
A: Check the HTTP status code:
- 200: Success
- 404: Not found or not owned by user
- 401: Authentication failed
- 409: Conflict (duplicate email, etc.)
