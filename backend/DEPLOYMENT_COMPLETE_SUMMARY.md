## 📈 What Happens Next (Campaign Builder)

### When You Requested:
> "when selecting the campaign that should be the first command to be shown as campaign details and user should be able to make edits to the message which can be send keeping in all edit commands in place - this has to be dynamic as some company will have all the details and this is where AI enrich data applies"

### What Needs to Be Built (Frontend):

#### 1. **Company Preview Panel**
When selecting companies for campaign:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🏢 Acme Corp                           │
│  📍 Boston, MA  •  👥 51-200  •  💼 Tech│
│                                         │
│  🎯 Hiring Intent:                      │
│  "Expanding AI/ML team"                 │
│                                         │
│  💡 AI-Generated Pitch:                 │
│  "Your rapid growth in AI presents..."  │
│                                         │
│  🎥 Video: [Watch] youtube.com/xyz      │
│                                         │
│  [✏️ Edit Pitch]  [✨ Re-enrich]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 2. **Dynamic Message Editor**
```tsx
<MessageEditor>
  <CompanySelect onChange={setSelectedCompanies} />

  {selectedCompanies.map(company => (
    <CompanyMessageCard company={company}>
      {/* If enriched */}
      {company.pitch ? (
        <EditablePitch
          defaultValue={company.pitch}
          variables={{
            companyName: company.name,
            hiringIntent: company.hiringInfo,
            videoUrl: company.videoUrl
          }}
        />
      ) : (
        /* If NOT enriched */
        <button onClick={() => enrichCompany(company.id)}>
          ✨ Enrich with AI
        </button>
      )}
    </CompanyMessageCard>
  ))}
</MessageEditor>
```

#### 3. **Template Variables**
```javascript
// User can use these in messages:
{{companyName}}      // Acme Corp
{{hiringIntent}}     // Expanding AI team
{{industry}}         // Healthcare Technology
{{videoUrl}}         // youtube.com/xyz
{{pitch}}            // Full AI-generated pitch
{{contactName}}      // John Doe
```
