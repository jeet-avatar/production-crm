# ✅ Database Cleaned - Instructions to Clear All Cached Data

## Database Status ✅
- **Contacts**: 0 (all deleted)
- **Companies**: 0 (all deleted)
- **Campaigns**: 0 (all deleted)
- **Tags**: 0 (all deleted)

## No Hardcoded Data Found ✅
I've searched the entire codebase and confirmed:
- ✅ No "Slingshot" or hardcoded company names in backend
- ✅ No mock or dummy data in frontend components
- ✅ No hardcoded contacts or companies arrays
- ✅ All data comes from the database via API calls

## Why You're Still Seeing Data

The data you're seeing is **cached in your browser**. Here's what's cached:

### 1. Browser Cache
- JavaScript files (old API responses cached)
- LocalStorage data
- Session data
- Service Workers

### 2. API Response Cache
- Axios may have cached responses
- Browser HTTP cache

### Step 2: Clear LocalStorage Manually

1. **Open DevTools**:
   - Mac: `Cmd + Option + I`
   - Windows: `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`

2. **Go to Application Tab** (Chrome/Edge) or **Storage Tab** (Firefox)

3. **Clear LocalStorage**:
   - Find "Local Storage" in left sidebar
   - Click on `https://sandbox.brandmonkz.com`
   - Right-click → "Clear"
   - Or manually delete these keys:
     - `crmToken`
     - Any other keys you see

4. **Clear SessionStorage**:
   - Find "Session Storage" in left sidebar
   - Click on `https://sandbox.brandmonkz.com`
   - Right-click → "Clear"

---

### Step 3: Hard Refresh the Page

After clearing cache and storage:

- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Windows**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`

---

### Step 4: Verify Clean State

1. **Login again** (token was cleared)
2. **Go to Contacts page** - Should show "No contacts found"
3. **Go to Companies page** - Should show "No companies found"

---

### Step 5: Import Fresh Data

Now you can import your CSV file:

1. Click **"Import Contacts"**
2. Upload your CSV file
3. Map the fields correctly
4. Import

**The fixed logic will now**:
- ✅ Match companies by exact name only
- ✅ Filter out linkedin.com, facebook.com, twitter.com domains
- ✅ Assign each contact to their correct company
- ✅ Display each contact with their own company name and role

## Alternative: Incognito/Private Window

If you want to quickly test without clearing cache:

1. **Open Incognito/Private window**:
   - Chrome/Edge: `Cmd + Shift + N` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Windows)
   - Safari: `Cmd + Shift + N`
   - Firefox: `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows)

2. **Go to**: https://sandbox.brandmonkz.com
3. **Login** with your credentials
4. You should see clean slate (0 contacts, 0 companies)

---

## Technical Details

### What Was Checked:
1. ✅ Database: 0 contacts, 0 companies (verified with Prisma)
2. ✅ Backend routes: No hardcoded data found
3. ✅ Frontend components: No mock data or hardcoded arrays
4. ✅ API configuration: Correctly pointing to sandbox.brandmonkz.com

### API Endpoint:
- Frontend makes calls to: `https://sandbox.brandmonkz.com/api`
- Backend is deployed and running
- Database is clean

### The Issue:
Your browser has **cached the old data** from before we cleaned the database. The browser is showing you the cached version of the contacts list instead of fetching fresh data from the API.

## Still Seeing Data?

If you still see contacts after following ALL steps above:

1. **Check if you're logged in as the right user**
   - The database might have multiple users
   - Each user has their own isolated data

2. **Try a different browser**
   - Use a browser you haven't used before
   - This guarantees no cache

3. **Check browser console for errors**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any API errors
   - Screenshot and share with me

4. **Verify API response**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Click on Contacts page
   - Find the `/api/contacts` request
   - Check the response - should show 0 contacts

---

## Summary

✅ Database is CLEAN (0 contacts, 0 companies)
✅ No hardcoded data in code
✅ API is working correctly
❌ Your browser has CACHED old data

**Solution**: Clear browser cache completely, clear LocalStorage, hard refresh, then login and import fresh data.
