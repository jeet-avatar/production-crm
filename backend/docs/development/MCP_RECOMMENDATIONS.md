## ðŸš€ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Enrichment Agent
Create an AI agent that:
1. Takes a company name
2. Uses Apollo/Clearbit to get company details
3. Uses Hunter.io to find executive emails
4. Auto-populates all CRM fields

**Example Agent Flow**:
```typescript
async function enrichCompany(companyName: string) {
  // 1. Get company info from Apollo
  const companyData = await apollo.searchCompany(companyName);

  // 2. Find decision makers
  const executives = await apollo.searchPeople({
    company: companyName,
    titles: ['CEO', 'CTO', 'CFO']
  });

  // 3. Generate AI pitch
  const aiPitch = await claude.generate({
    prompt: `Based on this company data: ${companyData},
             create a personalized AI solution pitch`
  });

  // 4. Save to CRM
  await prisma.company.update({
    data: {
      ...companyData,
      aiPitch,
      enriched: true
    }
  });
}
```

### Phase 2: Intelligent Email Campaign Agent
Create an AI agent that:
1. Reads contact's role and company info
2. Generates personalized email content
3. Schedules and sends emails
4. Tracks opens, clicks, responses

**Example Agent Flow**:
```typescript
async function sendIntelligentCampaign(contactId: string) {
  const contact = await getContactWithCompany(contactId);

  // AI generates personalized email
  const emailContent = await claude.generate({
    prompt: `Write a personalized sales email to ${contact.role}
             at ${contact.company.name}. Their tech stack:
             ${contact.company.techStack}. Their hiring intent:
             ${contact.company.hiringIntent}`
  });

  // Send via email composer
  await emailComposerApi.create({
    to: contact.email,
    subject: emailContent.subject,
    body: emailContent.body,
    tracking: true
  });
}
```

### Phase 3: Autonomous Lead Scoring Agent
Create an AI agent that:
1. Analyzes company hiring intent
2. Scores leads based on tech stack match
3. Prioritizes outreach based on job postings
4. Auto-assigns to sales reps

## ðŸ“¦ Quick Start: MCP Server Setup

      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-hunter"],
