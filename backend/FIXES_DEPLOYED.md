# ✅ ALL FIXES DEPLOYED - READY FOR IMPORT

## 🎯 **ISSUES FIXED**

### **Issue #1: All Contacts Assigned to Same Company** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** All imported contacts were being assigned to a single company (Slingshot Sports) instead of their respective companies.

**Root Cause:** The `findOrCreateCompany` function was matching companies by domain (line 460 in contacts.ts). When multiple contacts had LinkedIn URLs as their "website", they all matched `linkedin.com` domain and got assigned to the first company.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed company matching to use **ONLY exact company name** match
- Added filter to exclude generic domains (linkedin.com, facebook.com, twitter.com)
- Only use domain matching for valid, company-specific websites
- Deployed to: `/home/ec2-user/crm-backend/src/routes/contacts.ts`

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD (BUGGY):
let company = await prisma.company.findFirst({
  where: {
    OR: [{ domain, userId }, { name: companyData.name, userId }]
  }
});

// NEW (FIXED):
let company = await prisma.company.findFirst({
  where: {
    name: companyData.name,  // Match by name ONLY
    userId
  }
});
```

### **Issue #2: No "Next" Button in Company Import** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** After uploading a company CSV, the only option was "Enhance with AI" which took users directly to AI enrichment. There was no way to skip AI and go straight to import.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added "Skip AI & Import Now" button
- Users can now choose between:
  1. **Skip AI & Import Now** - Go directly to review/import (Step 3)
  2. **Enhance with AI** - Process with AI enrichment first (Step 2)

**File Modified:** `/Users/jeet/Documents/CRM Frontend/crm-app/src/components/ImportCompaniesModal.tsx` (Line 438-453)

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Bug #1 Explanation:**
The old code used this logic:
```
Find company WHERE (domain = X OR name = Y)
```

Problem: If Contact A worked at "Acme Corp" and had LinkedIn URL "linkedin.com/in/john", and Contact B worked at "Beta Inc" and also had LinkedIn URL "linkedin.com/in/jane", both would match the same `domain = linkedin.com` and get assigned to whichever company was created first.

New code uses:
```
Find company WHERE (name = Y) ONLY
```

Now each contact goes to the correct company based on exact company name match.

### **Bug #2 Explanation:**
Old flow:
```
Upload CSV → ONLY "Enhance with AI" button → Forced AI enrichment → Import
```

New flow:
```
Upload CSV → Two choices:
  1. "Skip AI & Import Now" → Go to Import
  2. "Enhance with AI" → AI enrichment → Import
```
