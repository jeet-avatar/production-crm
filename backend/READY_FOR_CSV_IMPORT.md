The script automatically detects and maps fields:

**For Companies:**
- Company Name, Organization, Business → `name`
- Website, URL, Domain → `website`
- LinkedIn URL → `linkedinUrl`
- Industry, Sector → `industry`
- Size, Employees → `size`
- Location, City, Country → `location`
- Description, About → `description`

**For Contacts:**
- First Name, Given Name → `firstName`
- Last Name, Surname → `lastName`
- Email, E-mail → `email`
- Phone, Mobile → `phone`
- Job Title, Position → `title`
- Company Name, Organization → links to company
- LinkedIn URL → `linkedinUrl`

### **Smart Features:**
- ✅ **Duplicate Detection** - Skips contacts/companies that already exist
- ✅ **Company Linking** - Automatically links contacts to their companies
- ✅ **Error Recovery** - Continues importing even if some rows fail
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** - Shows real-time progress every 50 records
- ✅ **Detailed Reporting** - Lists all errors and successes

```

## 🎮 **HOW TO START**

### **Option 1: Files are ready**
If you have the CSV files ready, just tell me:
```
"Files are at [path]" or "Files are uploaded"
```

And I'll run the import immediately.

### **Option 2: Different location**
If files are in a different location:
```
"Files are at /path/to/csv/files/"
```

And I'll adjust the script.

### **Option 3: Different format**
If your CSV has different columns, share:
```
- Header row from Company CSV
- Header row from Contacts CSV
```

And I'll customize the field mapping.

## ⚡ **QUICK START COMMAND**

Once files are in place, I'll run:

```bash
# Upload files to server
scp "NetSuite Users - Company Data.csv" ec2-user@18.212.225.252:/tmp/
scp "NetSuite Users - Decision Makers.csv" ec2-user@18.212.225.252:/tmp/

# Upload import script
scp scripts/import-netsuite-data.js ec2-user@18.212.225.252:/home/ec2-user/crm-backend/scripts/

# Run import
ssh ec2-user@18.212.225.252 "cd /home/ec2-user/crm-backend && CSV_PATH=/tmp node scripts/import-netsuite-data.js"
