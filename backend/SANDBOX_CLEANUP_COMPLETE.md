## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Data Was Showing:

1. **Wrong IP Used** (54.177.28.253)
   - Couldn't connect to verify/clean database
   - User thought database was unreachable

2. **Sandbox Database Had Old Data**
   - 319 contacts from previous imports
   - 61 companies from previous imports
   - Data was never cleaned from sandbox

3. **Local Database Was Clean**
   - 0 contacts, 0 companies
   - But frontend was connecting to sandbox API

4. **Frontend Uses Sandbox API**
   - Frontend: `https://sandbox.brandmonkz.com/api`
   - Sandbox backend returns data from sandbox database
   - Even though local database was clean

---

## ✅ FINAL STATUS

### Local Environment:
- **Database**: Clean (0 contacts, 0 companies) ✅
- **Prisma Studio**: Running at http://localhost:5555 ✅

### Sandbox Environment:
- **Server**: 18.212.225.252 (reachable) ✅
- **Database**: Clean (0 contacts, 0 companies) ✅
- **Backend**: Running (PM2 online) ✅
- **No Auto-Seeding**: Verified ✅

### Frontend:
- **API Endpoint**: https://sandbox.brandmonkz.com/api ✅
- **Now Returns**: Empty data (0 contacts, 0 companies) ✅

1. **Import Fresh Data**
   - Go to https://sandbox.brandmonkz.com
   - Import your CSV files
   - Each contact will be assigned to correct company (bug fixed)

2. **Verify Clean State**
   - Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
