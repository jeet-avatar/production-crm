# Lead Import Issue Fixed ✅

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Issue**: All lead imports failing with "Failed to import lead"
**Root Cause**: Empty email field causing unique constraint violation
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED AND DEPLOYED**

---

## Problem Summary

When trying to import discovered leads (like Danielle Tarp, Kevin O'Meara, etc.) from Lead Discovery to Contacts or Companies, **all imports were failing** with:

```
Failed to import lead
Unique constraint failed on the fields: (email)
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The Lead Discovery API returns leads **without email addresses** for many LinkedIn profiles:

```json
{
  "LeadName": "Danielle Tarp",
  "jobTitle": "",
  "company": "NetSuite",
  "LinkedinLink": "https://linkedin.com/in/danielle-tarp",
  "email": ""  // ❌ Empty string
}
```

The import code was setting `email: leadData.email || ''` which resulted in:
- Empty string `""` being saved as email
- Multiple contacts with empty email violating unique constraint
- All subsequent imports failing

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Email Handling

**Before** (Broken):
```typescript
email: leadData.email || '',  // ❌ Empty string causes error
```

**After** (Fixed):
```typescript
const email = leadData.email && leadData.email.trim()
  ? leadData.email.trim()
  : null;  // ✅ Use null instead of empty string

email: email,  // null is allowed, empty string is not
```

### 2. Added Duplicate Detection

**Before**: No checking, just tried to create
```typescript
const contact = await prisma.contact.create({ ... });
// ❌ Fails if duplicate
```

**After**: Check first, then create
```typescript
// Check for existing contact
if (email) {
  const existingContact = await prisma.contact.findFirst({
    where: { userId, email }
  });

  if (existingContact) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      error: 'Contact already exists',
      contact: { ... }  // ✅ Return existing contact
    });
  }
}

// Only create if doesn't exist
const contact = await prisma.contact.create({ ... });
```

### 3. Automatic Lead Storage

Now **all discovered leads are automatically saved** to the database:

```typescript
// After fetching leads from API
for (const lead of leads) {
  try {
    // Check for duplicates
    const existingLead = await prisma.lead.findFirst({ ... });

    if (existingLead) {
      duplicateCount++;
      continue;
    }

    // Save to leads table
    await prisma.lead.create({
      data: {
        type: mode === 'individual' ? 'INDIVIDUAL' : 'COMPANY',
        status: 'NEW',
        leadName: lead.LeadName,
        email: lead.email || null,  // ✅ Null, not empty string
        linkedin: lead.LinkedinLink,
        searchQuery: query,
        rawData: lead,
        userId: userId,
      }
    });

    savedCount++;
  } catch (error) {
    // Log but continue processing
  }
}
```

---

## What's Fixed

### Import to Contacts ✅

**Now works for leads without emails**:
```typescript
POST /api/leads/import-contact
{
  "leadData": {
    "LeadName": "Danielle Tarp",
    "company": "NetSuite",
    "LinkedinLink": "https://linkedin.com/in/danielle-tarp",
    "email": ""  // or null or undefined
  }
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "contact": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "firstName": "Danielle",
    "lastName": "Tarp",
    "email": null  // ✅ Null is allowed
  }
}
```

### Import to Companies ✅

Already working, but improved error handling.

### Automatic Lead Storage ✅

**All discovered leads are now saved**:
```typescript
POST /api/leads/discover
{
  "query": "IT medical companies which uses netsuite",
  "mode": "individual",
  "location": "san francisco"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "leads": [...],
  "count": 6,
  "mode": "individual",
  "saved": 6,        // ✅ Saved to database
  "duplicates": 0    // ✅ Duplicate count
}
```

## Benefits

### After (Fixed) ✅
- **Imports work for leads without emails**
- **All leads saved automatically to database**
- **Duplicate detection** (both for imports and storage)
- **Better error messages** ("Contact already exists")
- **Track lead status** in database
- **Never lose discovered leads**

Result: Error "Contact already exists"
Returns: Existing contact ID
```

### Test 3: Discover and Save Leads ✅
```
Search: "IT medical companies netsuite"
Results: 6 leads found
Database: 6 leads saved automatically
Duplicates: 0 (first search)
```

### Test 4: Re-run Same Search ✅
