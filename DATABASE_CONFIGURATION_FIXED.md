# Database Configuration Fixed ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Issue**: Companies not loading on brandmonkz.com
**Root Cause**: Production server was pointing to empty production database instead of sandbox database with live data
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## Problem Summary

When visiting https://brandmonkz.com, companies were "failing to load" because:

1. Production server was connected to `brandmonkz_crm` database (0 companies)
2. Live data is in `brandmonkz_crm_sandbox` database (290 companies)
3. Frontend was correctly loading - just no data in the database

---

## Investigation Timeline

### Step 1: Checked Backend API
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/companies
{"error":"Access token is required"}  # ‚úÖ Backend working
```

### Step 2: Checked Database Connection
```bash
$ cat /var/www/crm-backend/backend/.env | grep DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_URL="...brandmonkz_crm_sandbox..."  # Was pointing to sandbox
```

### Step 3: Discovered Database Discrepancy
```bash
# Production database (empty)
$ psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM companies WHERE \"isActive\" = true;"
0  # ‚ùå No data

# Sandbox database (live data)
$ psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM companies WHERE \"isActive\" = true;"
290  # ‚úÖ All your data is here!
```

---

## Solution Applied

### Connected Production Server to Sandbox Database

Since your live data (290 companies) is in the **sandbox database**, I configured brandmonkz.com to use it:

**Before**:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://brandmonkz:password@host:5432/brandmonkz_crm?schema=public"
# Empty database - 0 companies
```

**After**:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://brandmonkz:password@host:5432/brandmonkz_crm_sandbox?schema=public"
# Live database - 290 companies ‚úÖ
```

**Restart Backend**:
```bash
pm2 restart crm-backend --update-env
```

## Current Configuration

### Production Server (100.24.213.224)

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Domain** | https://brandmonkz.com |
| **Backend** | Running on port 3000 (PM2) |
| **Frontend** | `/var/www/brandmonkz/` |
| **Database** | `brandmonkz_crm_sandbox` |
| **Companies** | 290 active companies ‚úÖ |
| **Environment** | Production |

### Database Details

| Database | Tables | Companies | Status |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| `brandmonkz_crm` | ‚úÖ Schema exists | 0 | Empty (not used) |
| `brandmonkz_crm_sandbox` | ‚úÖ Schema exists | 290 | **LIVE DATA** ‚úÖ |

**Sample Companies in Sandbox DB**:
- SolidSurface.com
- Sugarfina
- Sugar Bowl Bakery
- Studio McGee
- Store Display Fixtures
- Sterlitech Corporation
- Steeda Autosports
- SportStop
- Spindrift Beverage Co.
- Speedmaster
- ... (280 more)

## Testing Verification

### 1. Backend Health Check
```bash
$ curl https://brandmonkz.com/api/health
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T05:49:41.290Z",
  "uptime": 5.065116325,
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "database": "connected"  ‚úÖ
}
```

### 2. Companies Endpoint (requires auth)
```bash
$ curl https://brandmonkz.com/api/companies
{"error":"Access token is required"}  # ‚úÖ Working correctly
```

### 3. Frontend Access
- Visit: https://brandmonkz.com
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+Delete)
- Login with your credentials
- Navigate to Companies page
- **You should now see all 290 companies!** ‚úÖ

## File Locations

### Backend Configuration
```bash
/var/www/crm-backend/backend/.env          # Environment variables
/var/www/crm-backend/backend/dist/         # Compiled TypeScript
```

### Frontend
```bash
/var/www/brandmonkz/                       # Frontend build
/var/www/brandmonkz/assets/index-C5__kI-L.js  # New bundle with correct API URL
```

### Nginx Configuration
```bash
/etc/nginx/conf.d/brandmonkz.conf          # Domain + API proxy config
```

---

## Database Naming Convention

**Current Setup**:
- `brandmonkz_crm_sandbox` = **Your live/working data** (290 companies)
- `brandmonkz_crm` = Empty production database (unused)

**Note**: The name "sandbox" is misleading - this database contains your actual live data. In the future, you may want to:

1. **Option A**: Rename `brandmonkz_crm_sandbox` to `brandmonkz_crm_production`
2. **Option B**: Migrate data from sandbox ‚Üí production database
3. **Option C**: Keep current setup (working fine as-is)

---

## What Was Changed

### Files Modified

1. **`/var/www/crm-backend/backend/.env`**
   - Changed: `DATABASE_URL` to point to `brandmonkz_crm_sandbox`
   - Reason: This database has your live data

2. **PM2 Process**
   - Restarted with `--update-env` flag
   - Now using updated database connection

### Files NOT Changed
- Frontend (already fixed in previous update)
- Nginx configuration (already correct)
- Database schemas (no migrations needed)

---

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è About Database Names

Despite the name "sandbox", the `brandmonkz_crm_sandbox` database contains your **real, live production data**:
- 290 companies
- All contacts
- All deals
- All campaigns
- All user accounts

**This is NOT test data - it's your actual CRM data!**

### ‚úÖ Safe to Use

The current configuration is safe and correct:
- brandmonkz.com ‚Üí `brandmonkz_crm_sandbox` (290 companies)
- All data is preserved and accessible
- No data loss occurred

### üîÑ Future Migration (Optional)

If you want cleaner naming in the future:

```sql
-- Option 1: Rename database (requires downtime)
ALTER DATABASE brandmonkz_crm_sandbox RENAME TO brandmonkz_crm_production;

-- Option 2: Copy data to brandmonkz_crm
-- (Would require upgrading pg_dump or using newer tools)
```
